Letra:You're a falling star
You're the getaway car
You're the line in the sand
When I go too far
You're the swimming pool
On an august day
And you're the perfect thing to say
And you play it coy but it's kinda cute
Oh when you smile at me
You know exactly what you do
Baby don't pretend that you don't know it's true
Cause you can see it when I look at you

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you
It's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything

You're a carousel
You're a wishing well
And you light me up
When you ring my bell
You're a mystery
You're from out of space
You're every minute of my every day

And I can't believe that I'm your man
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can
Whatever comes our way
We'll see it through
And you know that's what our love can do

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you
It's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything

And so la la la la... la la la
So la la la la... la la la

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you
It's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything...

You're every song
And I sing along
Cause you're my everything

Yeah, yeah

So la la la la... la la la
So la la la la... la la-la-la... la-la-la
