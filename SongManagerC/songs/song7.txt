Letra:Hello
It's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over
Everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello
Can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger
And free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference
Between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello
How are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope
That you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oohh, anymore
Oohh, anymore
Oohh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore
