Letra:Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk.
Music loud and women warm,
I've been kicked around since I was born.
And now it's all right, it's okay,
you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
the New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.

Oh, when you walk.

Well, now I get low and I get high,
and when I can't get either, I really try.
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes,
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.
You know, it's all right, it's okay,
I'll live to see another day.
We can try to understand
the New York Times' effect on man.

Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me,
somebody help me, yeah.
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah.
I'm stayin' alive.

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk.
Music loud and women warm,
I've been kicked around since I was born.
And now it's all right, it's okay,
you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
the New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.
